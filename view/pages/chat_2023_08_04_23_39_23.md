1. **You**: get user by id in wordpress
2. **ChatGPT**: To get a user by their ID in WordPress, you can use the `get_userdata` function, which retrieves the user data for a specific user based on their ID. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```php
$user_id = 123; // replace with the ID of the user you want to retrieve

$user_data = get_userdata($user_id);

if ($user_data !== false) {
    // User data found
    $user_username = $user_data->user_login;
    $user_email = $user_data->user_email;
    $user_nicename = $user_data->user_nicename;

    // Now you can use the retrieved user data as needed
    echo "Username: " . $user_username;
    echo "Email: " . $user_email;
    echo "Nicename: " . $user_nicename;
} else {
    // User data not found
    echo "User not found.";
}
```

In the code above, you need to replace `$user_id` with the actual ID of the user you want to retrieve. The `get_userdata` function returns an object with user data, and you can access specific properties (such as `user_login`, `user_email`, `user_nicename`, etc.) using the object notation (`$user_data->property_name`).
